Ideas:
======

None of the ideas below are complete enough to be a proposal on their own. You need to tell use how you plan on completing the feature or task not just what the feature is.

Don’t feel limited to just the ideas here, feel free to propose your own project or features to an existing project at Code for America.

###Open311
The non emergency request standard http://open311.org  It’s a standard API that many cities have already adopted. 
Its time to make it better, more powerful for analysis, and more useful to cities that have invested in it. 
By making it more useful, we will be adding incentive for more cities to support this and other standards.

* Build API for collecting and analysis of 311 of all cities using the standard, work to help define an analysis API 
for apps similar to [http://311.fm](http://311.fm)
* Work on dashboard and visualization tools for public
* Work on better tools for cities to manage their 311 requests both in the office and in the field

###Automated Data Matching
Governments have a lot of data that has been keep in different “silos”, part of the power of these dataset goes 
beyond using 1 dataset alone, but mashing them up. That’s been very powerful on the web, now we want to make 
that easier to do inside of city hall.

* Building an interface on top of tools like [dedupe](http://github.com/open-city/dedupe) to make it easier to 
setup and use
  * Better interfaces for training a match dataset
  * Better automated tooling for repeating the process
* Normalizers for [addresses](https://github.com/codeforamerica/address-normalizer), names, locations, etc

###Civic APIs
Lets make working with Civic data easier! Work on an API for crime data, business license info, 
food inspection, building info. We are working on collecting data and making civic data readily 
available and useful. 

* Work on new APIs for civic data. 
* Create Libraries (Gems, modules, etc) for using existing civic APIs
* Build tools to make it easy for cities to provide their data in standard formats / APIs
  * Validators
  * Parsers / converters to other formats


###Adopt-a
Cities can be stronger when residents pitch in and help even with something small.  In Boston they adopt 
fire hydrants to shovel them out, in Honolulu the adopt warning sirens to make sure they are working properly.  
This apps should make it easier for residents to band together to help their city, not just more work. 
See the [adopta repo on github](http://github.com/codeforamerica/adopta)

* Extend Adopt-a and make it more reusable
* Add an API so new interfaces can be used to adopt.
* Build better stats into the site (and API) to provided public usage info.
